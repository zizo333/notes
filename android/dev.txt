* logic: MainActivity.kt , UI(Layout): activity_main.xml
* Android SDK -> Software Development Kit
* minimum sdk -> the app will run on devices with this level API or higher
* Android versions -> have a version number of android (eg: 9.0) + code name (eg: Pie)
* The API level refers to the version of the APIs used by apps
    - the equivalent API level for Android version 9.0 is 28.
* After Pie -> code name is a number (version number: 10.0 & code name: 10)
* Android Studio projects use the (Gradle build) system to compile and deploy apps,
* AVD -> Android Virtual Device.
* APK -> Android applicaiton package.
* Run the app
    - (Kotlin) -> compiled -> (Bytecode) 
      (Bytecode + libraries + resources) -> (APK)
      (Apk) file -> is installed on the device
                    - if the device is virtual: Android Studio launches the emulator and waits until the 
                      AVD is active before installing the APK
                    - If the device is physical, it just installs the APK.
    - The device starts the appâ€™s main activity.
* Emulator & AVD
    - Emulator:
        Think of an emulator like a virtual smartphone or tablet on your computer.
        It lets developers test their Android apps without needing a physical device.
    - AVD (Android Virtual Device):
        An AVD is a specific setup for your virtual device.
        It's like deciding what version of Android your virtual device will have, what kind of phone it is, and its screen size.
        AVDs are managed using the AVD Manager in Android development tools.

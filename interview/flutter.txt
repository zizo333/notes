4. What is the Difference Between Stateless and Stateful Widget in Flutter?
    * There are two types of widgets in flutter -> Stateless & Stateful widgets.
    * Stateless -> No changes in its value.
                -> override the createState and return the State class.
                -> used when user want to change UI dynamically.
                -> calling setState to redraw the widget.
    * Stateful  -> It is a widget that changes its value -> using the State class.
                -> override the build and return the widget.

5. What is StatefulWidget LifeCycle?
    * createState() -> return State.
    * initState() -> It is the first method called after the Widget is created. (it is called once). -> used for initializations. 
    * didChangeDependencies() -> it is called after initState(). -> after the context is built.
    * build() -> This is called right after didChangeDependencies(). All the GUI is rendered here and will be called every single time the UI needs to be rendered.
    * didUpdateWidget() -> Itâ€™ll be called once the parent Widget did a change and needs to redraw the UI.
    * deactivate() ->  Framework calls this method whenever it removes this State object from the tree.
    * dispose() -> It is called when this object and its State are removed from the tree permanently and will never build again.
